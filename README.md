This is the code for paper "Spatial-Angular Attention Network for Light Field Reconstruction"


## Note for Code
1. Environment -Python 3.7.4, tensorflow-gpu==1.13.1 <br>
2. You should first upload your light fields to "./Datasets/". <br>
3. The code for 3D light field (1D angular and 2D spatial) reconstruction is "main3d.py". Recommend using the model with upsampling scale \alpha=3 for x8 or x9 reconstruction, and the model with upsampling scale \alpha=4 for x16 reconstruction. <br>
